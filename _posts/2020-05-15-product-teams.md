I stumbled upon an interesting opinion about an engineering team's organization.
I've never looked from that perspective and never worked
in an "empowered product team" ðŸ˜„

## Product Teams

Characteristics

- Cross-functional
- Measured by outcomes
- Empowered to solve the problems

The Team **purpose**: to solve problems in ways our customers love, yet work for our business.

## Feature Teams

The Team **purpose**: to implement items of a prioritized list (roadmap, backlog, etc).

Key differences

- in PT, the product manager is responsible for the value and viability risks
- in FT, the stakeholders are responsible for the value and viability risks
- in FT, the product manager is a facilitator (a project manager)
