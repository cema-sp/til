Clarified the two terms for myself.

**Mentorship** - a relationship between an experienced person and someone who 
wants to grow. Mentee is defining measurable goals and execute on the plan. 
Mentor is helping with advice, guidance, suggestions, support.
Both review and measure the progress.

**Coaching** - is helping people to help themselves. No guidance, "ask, don't tell".
Coach helps coachee to recognize areas of development, to reflect, to 
challenge themselves, and to be accountable.

Both relationships have common grounds such as identifying strengths and 
weaknesses, visualizing the desired future, and identifying goals.

Coaching is more abstract and less guided. Coach doesn't have to be more 
experienced in the target area than the coachee.
